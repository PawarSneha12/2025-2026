Given an sorted array arr[] of integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place). In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5] ..... and so on. If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Note: The given array is sorted in ascending order, and modify the given array in-place without returning a new array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in the waveform are 2, 1, 4, 3, 5.

class Solution {
    public void sortInWave(int arr[]) {
        int n=arr.length;
        for (int i=0;i<n-1;i=i+2)
        {
            
            int a=arr[i];
            arr[i]=arr[i+1];
            arr[i+1]=a;
        }
        return ;
        
    }
}
